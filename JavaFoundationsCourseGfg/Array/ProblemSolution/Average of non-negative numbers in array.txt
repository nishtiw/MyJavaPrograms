Question: You are given an array numbers that contains integers. You need to return average of the non negative integers.

Example 1:
Input:
numbers = [-12, 8, -7, 6, 12, -9, 14]
Output:
avg = 10.0
Explanation: The positive numbers are
8 6 12 14.
The sum is 8+6+12+14 = 40,
Average = 40/4 = 10.0

Example 2:
Input:
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
Output:
avg = 2.0
Explanation: The positive numbers are
1 2 3.
The sum is 1+2+3 = 6, Average = 6/3 = 2.0

Solution: 
public static double posAverage(int[] numbers){
    //Write your code to find average of positive numbers in numbers array
    //return the answer
    double sum = 0; 
    int count = 0;
    for(int number: numbers)
    {
        if(number>=0)
        {
            sum += number;
            count++;
        }
    }
    return sum/count;
    
}

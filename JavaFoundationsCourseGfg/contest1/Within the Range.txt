Question: You are given a positive number n, you need to return true if it is within 3 of a multiple of 10. The multiples of 10 are 0, 10, 20, 30 and so on. So, within 3 of 0 means -3 to +3, and within 3 of 10 means 7 to 13 and similarly for the others.

Example 1
Input:
n = 5
Output:
False
Explanation:
5 is not within 3 of any multiple of 10

Example 2
Input:
n = 7
Output:
True
Explanation:
7 is 10-3, and hence it is within 3 of a multiple of 10.

Solution:
public static String withinTheRange(int n){
    
    //return a string True or False according to the n
   
   if(n%10==7 || n%10==8 || n%10==9 || n%10==0 || n%10==1 || n%10==2 || n%10==3)
   {
       return "True";
   }
   else
   {
       return "False";
   }
   
}

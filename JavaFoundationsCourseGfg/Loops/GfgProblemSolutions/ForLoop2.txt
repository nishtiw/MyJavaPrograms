Question: You are given a String S, you need to print its characters at even indices(index starts at 0). 

Example:
Input:
s = "Geeks"
Output:
Ges
Explanation:
The even indices characters are printed.

Solution: 
public static void utility(String s){
    // Length of string is given by s.length()
    // character at any index i is given by s.charAt(i)
    
    //Write your code here
    for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
        if(i%2 == 0) {
            System.out.print(s.charAt(i));
        }
    }
}

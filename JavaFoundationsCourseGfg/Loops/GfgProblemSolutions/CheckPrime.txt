Question: Given an integer n check if n is prime or not. A prime number is a number that is divisible by 1 and itself only. 

Example 1:

Input:
n = 17
Output: 
True
Explanation:
17 is  divisible by  only 1 and 17.
So it's a prime number.

Solution:
public static boolean prime(int n){
    
    //Write your code here
    //returns a boolean value 
    if(n == 1)
    {
        return false;
    }
    for(int i=2; i<n; i++)
    {
        if(n%i == 0)
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
    
}

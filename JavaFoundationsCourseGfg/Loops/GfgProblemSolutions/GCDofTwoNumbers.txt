Question: Given two numbers A and B. The task is to find the GCD of  A and B. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that can divide both A and B perfectly. 

Example 1:

Input:
A = 6
B = 9
Output:
3
Explanation:
After 3 there is no number that can divide both 6 and 9 perfectly. 

Solution: 
public static int gcd(int a, int b){      
    //code here to calculate and return gcd of a and b
    int min = Math.min(a,b);
    int ans = 1;
    for(int i=1; i<=min; i++)
    {
        if(a%i == 0 && b%i == 0)
        {
            ans = i;
        }
    }
     return ans;   
}

Question: Given an integer n. Write a program to find the nth Fibonacci number.
The nth Fibonacci number is given by the forumla F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). The first few fibonacci numbers are: 1 1 2 3 5... and so on. 

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
Output: 
3
Explanation:
In the series 1 1 2 3 5...... the fourth fibonacci number is 3.

Solution: 
public static int fibonacci(int n){
        
    //Write your code here to calculate
    //to calculate the nth fibonacci number
        int a=1, b=1, c=1;
        for(int i=3; i<=n; i++)
        {
            if(i == n)
            {
                c = a + b;
                return c;
                
            }
            c = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = c;
        }
        return c;
}
